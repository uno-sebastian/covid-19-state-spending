GA,"On February 3, 2021, we moved Georgia’s history of Positive Antigen Tests (people) to Probable Cases, since the state calls the metric “antigen positive cases.” We also backfilled Positive (people, confirmed + probable) to include these values. This change resulted in the addition of 162,028 cases in Georgia distributed over the timeseries from November 3, 2020 onward. Georgia does not provide a full history of this number, so on November 3, 2020 we record 29,937 probable cases for Georgia, many of which do not date to that day.

On January 6, 2021, Georgia stated on its dashboard that its data would be delayed several hours “due to a high volume of data to process.” Georgia’s data did not update before for our publication time. We were able to update their Currently hospitalized from their separate [hospitalization source](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/e40c39564f724af7bfe8fd5d88deadb6).

On November 13, 2020, we backfilled the **Total PCR tests (specimens)** time series to include only PCR testing, reported by the state in their data download file. This updates the previously reported series that until May 27, 2020 included both PCR and antibody tests.

On November 3, 2020, Georgia started reporting probable deaths and antigen positive cases in their COVID-19 Daily Status report. On November 4, we added the probable deaths in our **Deaths (probable)** field for November 3 and 4, causing the daily rise in deaths on the 3rd to appear as 480. This large increase includes the data dump of 450 probable deaths, many of which are not from the most recent 24 hour period. We also began recording the 29,937 antigen positive cases in our `positiveTestsPeopleAntigen` API field. We have reached out to Georgia's health department for clarity on the definition of this number. 

On October 21, 2020, Georgia did not update their ""COVID-19 Daily Status Report"" by the time of our daily update due to technical issues. In order to provide the most up to date data possible, we updated only **Current Hospitalizations**, which are sourced from a different Georgia government website.

As of September 18, 2020, Georgia's total test results are drawn from our `totalTestsViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative.

As of August 28, 2020, we started reporting patients Now hospitalized from the [Georgia Geospatial Information Office](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/e40c39564f724af7bfe8fd5d88deadb6). The new count includes both patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis and patients under investigation, as is our standard practice where possible.",https://dph.georgia.gov/covid-19-daily-status-report,https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/e40c39564f724af7bfe8fd5d88deadb6,https://augustagis.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/4eec20925b6b4f338368df0ffcba472d,,,@GaDPH,https://dph.georgia.gov/novelcoronavirus,Specimens,totalTestsViral,Total Tests (PCR),Only positives,False,Georgia,13
